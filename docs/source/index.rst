Welcome to rlutils's documentation!
===================================

rlutils is a python package containing utility functions to implement 
reinforcement learning simulations.  The goal of rlutils is to provide a useful 
base library to help implement reinforcement learning (RL) research projects.
This project can also be found at https://github.com/lucaslehnert/rlutils.

rlutils provides an API to implement RL agents, policies, and simulate them in a
control task (also called environment or Markov Decision Process (MDP)). rlutils
also provides implementations to some basic policies, value iteration, and 
Q-learning. Other utility functions are also included to collect trajectories, 
store them, and replay them.

rlutils' goal is to provide a framework and utility functions for implementing 
RL algorithms.

If you have any questions about rlutils, please send email to 
`lucas_lehnert@brown.edu`.
